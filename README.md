# Testing React Components

This is a demo project that implements a simple counter with different testing approaches. 

The first approach is TDD and leads to a more modular code base. However, it creates more boilerplate

The second approach focuses on integration tests as main tool and leads too a more tightly coupled code base, reducing the boilerplate a bit.

## Tests

### Unit
